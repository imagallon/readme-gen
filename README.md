## Description
    This app allows users to generate README.md files based on user input. Using this app will streamline the format for all future README files for upcoming apps. I learned how to work with templet literals, the file system for writing files, and how to work with inquirer. I am excited to learn more about different packages through npm, and how they can help me on future projects

## Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
